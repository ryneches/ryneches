### Russell's GitHub stuff

I'm an assistant professor at Kyoto University. Right now, I'm studying the evolution of
[Nucleocytoviricota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleocytoviricota), which includes the 
[giant viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_virus). I build theoretical approaches to
evolutionary questions, and sometimes [write software](https://github.com/ryneches/SuchTree) to
explore those questions.
